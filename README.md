# BeWoke
<sub>This was an app I made in a few hours for the [Entreprenuer First](https://www.joinef.com/) hackathon, where I won **first place!**</sub>

_**Morning alarms got you like this?**_

**Sleep in no more.**

BeWoke is a better alarm. Briefly tell the app the first thing you're doing next morning, and wake up in horror as the alarm doesn't turn off until you take a picture of yourself doing that exact thing.

Inspiried by BeReal, BeWoke has a gamified social aspect to it. After you post your morning check-in, you also see your friends' check-ins. You gain points for waking up on time.

In the future there could be prizes for most improved or most consistient sleep schedule, similar to BeReal's [Realest Person on Earth](https://www.realestpersononearth.com/) competition, where people compete to have the most epic BeReals, and win a cash prize or a trip around the world.



Random Notes:

- Voting
- Etc.
- This app can go a long way! Alarms are just the beginning.
