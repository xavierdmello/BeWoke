# BeWoke

Have trouble waking up in the morning?

BeWoke is a better alarm. Briefly tell the app the first thing you're going to do next morning, and then watch in horror as the alarm doesn't turn off until you take a picture of yourself doing that exact thing the next morning.

Inspiried by BeReal, BeWoke has a gamified social aspect to it. After you post your morning check-in, you also see your friends' check-ins. You gain points for waking up on time.

In the future there could be prizes for most improved or most consistient sleep schedule, similar to BeReal's [Realest Person on Earth](https://www.realestpersononearth.com/) competition, where people compete to have the most epic BeReals, and win a cash prize or a trip around the world.
